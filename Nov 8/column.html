            <p>CURRENT ELECTRICITY
                1. What is current electricity ?
                Current electricity. In chapters 1 and 2, we studied
                the phenomena associated with the electric charges at
                rest. The physics of charges at rest is called
                electrostatics or static electricity. We shall now study
                the motion or dynamics of charges. As the term current
                implies some sort of motion, so the motion of electric
                charges constitutes an electric current.
                The study of electric charges in motion is called current
                electrici ty.
                3.2 ELECTRIC CURRENT
                2. Define electric current.
                El~tric current. If two bodies charged to different
                poten .als are connected together by means of a
                conduc ing wire, charges begin to flow from one body
                to another. The charges continue to flow till the
                potentials of the two bodies become equaL
                Theflow of electric chargesthrough a conductor constitutes
                an electric current. Quantitatively, electric current in a
                conductor across an area held perpendicular to the direction
                or offlow of charge is defined as the amou nt of chargeflowing
                across that area per unit time.
                If a charge t.Q passes through an area in time t to
                t + M, then the current I at time t is given by
                
                1= lim
                Ilt -7 a
                t.Q = dQ
                M dt
                
                If the current is steady i.e., the rate of flow of charge
                does not change with time, then
                1= Q
                t
                
                EI
                . Electric charge
                or ectnc current = ------"'-
                Time
                
                where Q is the charge that flows across the given area
                in time t.
                Lightning, which is the flow of electric charge
                between two clouds or from a cloud to the earth, is an
                example of a transient current (a current of short
                duration). But the charges flow in a steady manner in
                devices like a torch, cell-driven clock, transistor radios,
                hearing aids, etc.
                3. Give the 51 unit of current.
                SI unit of current is ampere. If one coulomb of charge
                crosses an area in one second, then the current through that
                area is one ampere (A).
                1
                1coulomb
                ampere = ----
                Isecond
                
                Ampere is one basic SI unit. We shall formally define it
                in chapter 4 in terms of magnetic effect of current.
                Smaller currents are expressed in following units:
                1milliampere = 1mA = 10-3A
                1microampere = 1!iA = 10-6A</p>
